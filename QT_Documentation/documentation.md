# Documentation of QT_tutorials

This file provides a summary of the Python scripts in the `QT_Documentation` directory. Each script is a small example demonstrating a specific concept in PySide6.

---

### `dialog_App.py`

This script demonstrates how to create a simple dialog application. It includes a QLineEdit for text input and a QPushButton. When the button is clicked, a greeting is printed to the console, showcasing how to connect a button's clicked signal to a slot (a function).

---

### `free_function.py`

This script demonstrates that a Qt signal can be connected to a "free" function, meaning a function that is not a method of a class. It creates a simple QPushButton and connects its 'clicked' signal to a standalone function.

---

### `generatingclass.py`

This script illustrates how to use a Python class generated from a Qt Designer .ui file. It imports the `Ui_MainWindow` class from the `ui_mainwindow.py` file and uses it to construct the user interface for the main window. This is a common pattern for separating UI design from application logic.

---

### `hello_world.py`

This is a fundamental "Hello, World!" example using PySide6. It demonstrates creating a simple application with a QLabel widget. The label's text is styled using HTML formatting to change its color and size.

---

### `simpleButtom.py`

This script provides a basic example of a QPushButton in PySide6. It demonstrates how to create a button, connect its 'clicked' signal to a Python function (a "slot"), and use the @Slot decorator.

---

### `slot_signals.py`

This script explains the concept of custom signals and slots in PySide6. It defines a `Communicate` class with an overloaded signal `speak` that can emit either an integer or a string. It also shows how to connect these signals to a slot that is decorated to handle both data types, demonstrating signal/slot overloading and type-based dispatch.

---

### `table_widget.py`

This script shows how to use the QTableWidget to display tabular data. It creates a table and populates it with a list of colors, showing the color name, its hexadecimal code, and a swatch of the actual color. It includes a helper function to convert hex color codes into QColor objects.

---

### `tree_widget.py`

This script demonstrates the use of QTreeWidget to display hierarchical data. It creates a tree structure from a Python dictionary, where dictionary keys are top-level items (e.g., project names) and values are their children (e.g., file names). The script also shows how to set column headers.

---

### `ui_mainwindow.py`

This file is automatically generated by the Qt User Interface Compiler (pyside6-uic). It translates the UI design from a .ui file (created with Qt Designer) into Python code. **WARNING!** All changes made in this file will be lost when recompiling the .ui file! It is not intended to be edited manually. Instead, create a separate Python script that imports this class and uses it to build the application logic.

---

### `uidirectly.py`

This script demonstrates how to load a Qt Designer .ui file directly at runtime using the QUiLoader class. This is an alternative approach to generating a static Python UI file. It allows for more dynamic loading of user interfaces.
