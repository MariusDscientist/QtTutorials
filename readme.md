# PySide6 Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is a personal learning space where I study and experiment with **PySide6 (Qt for Python)**.

The goal of this repo is not to present a finished product, but to **document my learning process**, understand core Qt concepts, and build solid foundations for creating desktop applications in Python.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Learn how Qt works from the ground up
- Understand signals, slots, widgets, layouts, and event handling
- Practice building simple GUIs and small experiments
- Prepare myself to build more complex desktop tools in the future

This repository represents **how I learn**, not just what I already know.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered (and growing)

- PySide6 basics
- Widgets (`QPushButton`, `QLabel`, etc.)
- Signals & Slots
- Event-driven programming
- Application lifecycle
- Project structure basics

More topics will be added progressively as I continue studying.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- PySide6 (Qt for Python)

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each file or folder represents a **small experiment or concept**, usually focused on a single idea.

The structure may evolve as the learning progresses.

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an active learning repository.  
Code may be experimental, incomplete, or intentionally simple.

That’s part of the process.

---

## ☕ Notes

If you’re also learning PySide6 or Qt, feel free to explore the code.
If you want to discuss ideas or improvements, I’m always open to a conversation.

**Learning by building. One concept at a time.**
